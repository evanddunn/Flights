logic:

1. on search button click, the 3 data pieces we ask for (whereTo, whereFrom, date),
need to be fed into (one or more) API calls to get back all the flights from
whereTo to whereFrom on date.
2. the flights from that API call need to be formatted to be displayed in a user
friendly way, showing the departure time, arrival time, and cost
2.5 append button to allow user to reserve flight
3. at the bottom a slider needs to be appended

~more difficult~

1. as the slider moves, we need to somehow constantly be checking for airports
within that distance from the whereTo airport. Once an alternative airport is found,
we need to call with the same whereFrom and the new whereTo on the same date and
append that, along with
  ~even harder~
the drive time from new whereTo from original whereTo and how much cheaper
new whereTo is from original whereTo (meaning we'll need to check that it is in fact
cheaper before we append it)


~back the hardness down a bit~

1. when a user chooses to reserve a flight, clear the body and build a totally new
page where the user inputs ASL info. Then a lot of backend updating needs to happen
from the data in the form when the user submits the form
